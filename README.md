# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project  
(Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising money from a large number of people)  

I am helping an up-and-coming playwright, Louise, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, Fever.  
She is estimating a budget of over $10,000 and is hesitant about jumping into her first fundraising campaign.  
  
In this project, I will be using excel to organize, sort, and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a projectâ€™s campaign successful.  

### Purpose  
Analyzing a dataset consisting of 4,000 crowdfunding projects to discover hidden trends.  
We will use these insights to help Louise plan her own and set it up for success.  

## Analysis

#### Outcomes based on Launch Date
![Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date](Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)  
- Based on the chart data, the best months to start a theater campaign are between May to July.
- The worst time for the campain is between September to to December. The number of successful campaigns steadily decreases each month in the Spring all the way to Winter time.  

#### Outcomes based on Goals
![Outcomes vs Goals](Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
- Campaigns with cheaper goals are more likely to be successful (Less than $15,000)

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - Does not take into account any marketing strategies used to gather more backers to reach the campaign goal.
  - The average donation can be skewed by backers who donate more money. We cannot see the amounts that each backer donated to any given campaign.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - Number of outcomes by year.  
  - Number of outcomes by country.
